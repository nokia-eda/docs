# Installation Overview

There are several Deployment Options that can be used to run and deploy EDA:

[On-prem cluster](./on-prem-cluster.md)

:   Use your own Kubernetes cluster to deploy EDA. This can be used for most types of standard Kubernetes clusters.

[FSS cluster](./fss.md)

:   Use the FSS Deployer VM to deploy a Kubernetes cluster and follow the procedure to deploy EDA instead of FSS.

[macOS solution](./macos.md)

:   Deploy EDA on a Kubernetes environment running on your personal Macbook, whether it is ARM or Intel-based.

You can also customize your cluster following the [Installation customization](customize-install.md) guide. This will provide you with the details on how to manipulate the kpt packages to fit your specific needs and design.
