# Installation Overview

There are several Deployment Options that can be used to run and deploy EDA:

[Air-Gapped cluster](./air-gapped-cluster.md)

:   Set up an asset VM with the necessary content for an Air-Gapped installation, using the officially supported Talos deployment model.

[On-prem cluster](./on-prem-cluster.md)

:   Use your own Kubernetes cluster to deploy EDA. This can be used for most types of standard Kubernetes clusters.

[Playground using KinD](../../getting-started/try-eda.md)

:   Deploy EDA on a Kubernetes environment running on your personal Macbook, whether it is ARM or Intel-based.

[Playground on macOS](./macos.md)

:   Deploy EDA Playground in a Kubernetes environment running on your personal Macbook, whether it is ARM or Intel-based.

You can also customize your EDA installation following the [Installation customization](customize-install.md) guide. This will provide you with the details on how to manipulate the kpt packages to fit your specific needs and design.
