[Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com) is an open-source automation platform that allows you to automate tasks across a wide range of IT environments. It uses a simple, human-readable language to describe automation tasks, making it accessible to both developers and operations teams.  
In order to extend the platform and meet specific needs and target environments, Ansible allows users to create custom modules and plugins that are packaged as [Ansible collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections_guide/index.html) and hosted at [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/).

Nokia provides a set of Ansible collections specifically designed for the Event Driven Automation (EDA) platform that allow users to automate interactions with the EDA platform and manage the resources under its management.
